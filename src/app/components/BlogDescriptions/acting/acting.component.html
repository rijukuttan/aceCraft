        <p><b></b><i><span>Formal Wear Essentials For Women</span></i></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><span>Pulling off a formal attire is not cakewalk - not only do you have to pair
                clothes
                that suit you, but you have to make sure that they go with your work style as well. It is necessary to
                make
                sure
                that your wardrobe is equipped with all the basic formal outfit requirements. Given below are the top 5
                essentials:&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b></b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>A White Formal Shirt</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p><span>A button-down white formal shirt should be one of the most important items of
                your
                work wardrobe. High-collared </span><span>formal shirts are perfect for every
                formal
                function, both inside and outside of work. It’s highly adaptable - a white formal shirt can be worn
                inside
                your
                linen jackets, under your business suits or simply paired with formal trousers or skirts. Cotton and
                linen
                fabrics are the best for almost every weather condition.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><br><br></p>
        <p><b></b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Khaki Pants Or Chinos</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p><span>You just cannot miss out on the colour brown while setting up your office
                wardrobe. A
                pair of khaki pants or chinos is suitable for all types of weather! These can take you through formal
                functions,
                board meetings, office parties and even corporate lunches. Brown khaki pants or chinos capture the
                perfect
                balance of colour as they are not as dark as black, or as light as pastel colours. They can also be
                paired
                with
                both light and dark coloured tops.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><br><br><br><br></p>
        <p><b></b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Plain Black Pumps</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p><span>A pair of plain black pump shoes with a small heel or no heel can be your best
                option
                for office parties, lunches or even formal events. They go extremely well with every formal outfit you
                wear.
                If
                you are not a fan of accessories that are plain, you can always go for ones with small handwork or
                minimal
                designs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><br><br></p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Pencil Skirts</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p><span>Pencil skirts are the most versatile pieces of your formal wardrobe. You can pair
                it
                with literally everything - a tucked-in formal shirt, a formal top or even a semi-formal shirt. Pencil
                skirts go
                very well with pump shoes or stilettos as well. Petite women can opt for a fitted, short pencil skirt
                whereas
                pear-shaped women can go for slightly longer pencil skirts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p></p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>A Tote Bag</b></li>

        <p><span>Professional-looking tote bags in a range of formal colours are definitely great
                add-ons to your formal outfit. Colours such as grey, brown, red, or black can be the perfect choice to
                complete
                your office look. If you’re a person that carries a lot of documents around or a laptop, a stiff
                professional
                tote bag can accommodate all your belongings while adding colour to your formal outfit.&nbsp;</span></p>
