                <p><span></span></p>
                <p><span>Seema Punjabi, a former corporate professional, embarked on the journey of
                                turning her love for baking into a full-fledged inspirational brand. Sugar Fairy stands
                                testament to Seema's
                                pursuit of her passion and innovation in her field.</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span>Having worked in a corporate set up since 2012, Seema indulged in her joy of
                                baking and desserts by training under a leading home baker in Bangalore in the year
                                2015. The year was
                                eventful, and in due course Seema set up Sugar Fairy, with personalized, home baked
                                pastries being her
                                forte. When she first began, she was encouraged by those around her and the constructive
                                feedback and
                                brilliant reviews only has served to further drive her bake more! Seema relates that the
                                first ever order
                                that kick started her career was placed by her boss.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span>Seema is drawn to her field by an undying and fervent appreciation for desserts.
                                Being an ardent foodie, she understands the role her creation plays in any event. Seema
                                says that every
                                effort put in is paid off when she sees the smiles as people dig in to her food!</span>
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span>Her journey since then has not always been a bed of soft fondant rolls, but one
                                that has been challenging, exciting and full of surprises. &nbsp;</span><span>There was
                                once, reminisces Seema, when she baked 1000 cupcakes for one of Titan
                                Skinn’s success parties and although it was challenging, Seema with the help of a fellow
                                baker who had a
                                bigger unit baked continuously for two whole days. Seema narrates a few highlights down
                                the road such as the
                                time she baked a 22kg “Ferrari” themed cake, the biggest one she's baked thus
                                far!&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span>Her customers go beyond the expected range of little kids to suited up corporate
                                professionals, for Seema was even called on to cater to a lovely Indie, furry-pawed
                                friend as she just
                                turned one with a pet friendly cake. More recently Seema was awarded the title “Best
                                Home Baker” from a
                                celebrated restaurant in the city.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span>Seema’s work is driven by innovation, constantly improving with constructive
                                criticism from those most important to her: her clients. Seema relates the story of how
                                she once</span>
                        <span>got a very bad review from one of her clients on the aspects of packaging and
                                also because she got the name wrong. This put into perspective the significance of
                                detail in her work and
                                she now is so much more meticulous, making sure to have everything perfectly in
                                place.</span>
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span>Seema believes that in the field of entrepreneurship, personal style is very
                                important as it gives you confidence and earns respect. Her preferred style would be a
                                comfortable formal
                                dress and jacket. She also trusts that comfort and look come hand in hand unlike many
                                who trust only in the
                                appearance. Well, you can’t go wrong with that, when your style icon is Kareena
                                Kapoor.</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span>While trying to get to know Seema outside her professional realm we learned that
                                her favourite book is “The secret by Rhonda Byrne” and also that like many of us, she
                                fangirls Salman Khan
                                and watches all his movies earnestly. She admires the famous Mumbai Pastry Chef Pooja
                                Dhingra, who’s work
                                consistently inspired her.</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span>&nbsp;Seema’s story has so much in common with her best-loved quote:</span></p>
                <p><span>“When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you achieve it” –
                                Paulo Coelho&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p><span>We don’t really have to wear an armour and fight the bad guys to be a superwoman.
                                While many women still swither with contemplation, a few decide to go out there and make
                                their dreams come
                                true. And there it is, The superwoman in us.</span></p>
