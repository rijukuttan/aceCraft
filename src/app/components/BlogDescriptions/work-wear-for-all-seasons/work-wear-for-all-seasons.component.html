                <p><span>Predicting seasonal changes is one of the most challenging aspects, but one of
                                the best advantages of experiencing different seasons is that we get a chance to work
                                our winter, summer or
                                autumn wardrobes! Even though the weather is always likely to be changing, Acecraft

                <p><b>What Works For Winter</b></p>
                <p><span>The weather could be ready to freeze us, but that shouldn’t affect what we
                                wear.</span></p>
                <ul>
                        <li><span>A tailored suit is winter workwear at its best. A
                                        rich, jewel-toned plaid takes it up a notch as well!&nbsp;</span></li>
                        <li><span>A skirt suit makes for a fresh take on the classic
                                        pantsuit look. Make it work for a cold day by layering some stockings underneath
                                        and adding
                                        boots.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Style a menswear-inspired blazer and trousers with
                                        a pair of sleek stiletto boots for the perfect masculine-meets-feminine
                                        contrast.</span></li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>Hints For The Hot Weather&nbsp;</b></p>
                <p><span>Getting dressed during the hottest days of the year is hard, but with this guide,
                                you can look cool even during the year’s most scorching season!</span></p>
                <ul>
                        <li><span>Rethink classic looks - pair a dressy white
                                        T-shirt with your formal pants, and slip on some patterned mules for a
                                        contemporary spin on
                                        workwear.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Even your denim can be HR-approved, with the right
                                        styling. Consider a printed blazer to add a tailored accent to a more casual
                                        look.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Black and white looks great at work. Appropriate
                                        doesn't need to be boring, though: an immaculately ironed white shirt with
                                        Chloe-styled track pants is
                                        also chic.</span></li>
                        <li><span>A crisp cotton shirtdress is a must for summer.
                                        Whether you wear it with flats, sandals, or pumps, the classic tailoring keeps
                                        it feeling work
                                        appropriate.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>
                <p><b>Autumn Is Here</b></p>
                <p><span>This autumn, don't shy away from suits - just because the weather is cooler,
                                doesn't mean you can't wear your usual rotation of skirts.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <ul>
                        <li><span>Cover with a coat for particularly cold days. The
                                        suit can also straddle the mid-line with a simple shirt or tee for the warmer
                                        days.</span></li>
                        <li><span>Embrace blazers or cardigans if you’re feeling
                                        cold in a summer dress for an autumn outing.</span></li>
                        <li><span>When it comes to autumn, start with a well-fitting
                                        trouser and layer blouses, blazers, tees and even dresses on top.</span></li>

                <p><b>The Rainy Days&nbsp;</b></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t let the rain let you down. Follow these tips:</span></p>
                <ul>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go classic with an all-white look,
                                        topped with a
                                        classic trench. On drizzling days, opt for loafers that won’t be ruined by a few
                                        drops of rain.</span>
                        </li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pair a little black dress with
                                        knee-high boots.
                                        Top it off with a coat that covers most of your outfit to protect it from the
                                        elements.</span></li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a skirt-and-blouse look, keep
                                        warm by adding
                                        a pair of tights to your outfit. For work, slip into a pair of chunky heel boots
                                        that are both rain and
                                        office-friendly.</span></li>
                </ul>
