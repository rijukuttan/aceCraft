            <p><b></b><span>Formal wear only serves as the base - it’s the accessories you adorn
                    that
                    perfect the quintessential formal look. However, styling plays a massive role in the same. It should
                    ideally
                    have a little bit of everything to make your formal look a truly distinctive one. Here are a few
                    tips on
                    how
                    you can style your formal wear:&nbsp;</span></p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Pocket Squares </b><span>- These are a great,
                        suave
                        addition to your formal look. It’s not always necessary that your pocket square should match
                        your
                        formal
                        wear - it just shouldn't clash with it drastically.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cufflinks -</b><span> Cufflinks add a touch of
                        class
                        to your suit. Adding cufflinks to your shirt will keep it firm and in place as well.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Watches -</b><span> Your watch should be just as
                        dressy as the suit your wear. Watches made from stainless steel are a great complement to your
                        meeting
                        look.&nbsp;</span></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Tie Clip -</b><span> The best way to complete
                        your
                        formal look (and also keep your tie in place) is to go for a simple tie clip. It also works to
                        keep
                        your
                        tie neat and wrinkle-free throughout the day!</span></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Belt -</b><span> Leather belts are always a
                        popular
                        choice. An essential tip is to always match your belt with your formal shoes.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Footwear</b><span>- Footwear is arguably one of
                        the
                        most important pieces of clothing in an outfit for men. Always opt for leather or suede as it
                        rounds
                        off
                        your formal look with a refined touch.&nbsp;</span></li>

            <p><b>Accessories For Women - Tips:&nbsp;</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Scarves - <span>If you’re feeling chilly or if the weather allows for
                            it,</span> <span>it’s always good to wear a professional-looking scarf
                            with a suit. Just keep in mind that the scarves you choose should be accessory ones, and not
                            winter
                            scarves.&nbsp;</span></b></li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Belt - <span>A thin belt accentuates any woman’s figure, so it’s essential
                            for
                            you to choose a slim one that is in a contrast colour from your outfit. The belt and shoe
                            rule
                            that
                            is a must for men doesn’t usually apply for women, though.&nbsp;</span></b></li>
                <li><b>Jewellery - <span>If you’re heading for any formal event,</span> <span>avoid wearing large
                            costume jewellery. Earrings should be conservative
                            and
                            small. Necklaces are acceptable, as long as they are delicate or are pendants. An elegant
                            watch
                            is a
                            must</span></b></li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Purse/Handbag - <span>Always opt for a classy leather bag that can fit all
                            your
                            essentials like your laptop. This adds a touch of professionalism to your look.</span></b>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Hosiery - <span>If you’re wearing hosiery, it should always suit your skin
                            tone, and should not have any distracting patterns or designs.</span></b></li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
            <p><span>For both men and women, getting your accessories right is an integral part of
                    nailing the formal look. However, unless the base is right, the impact you create won’t be an
                    effective
                    one
