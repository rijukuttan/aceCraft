                <p><span>You’re doing great at your job, but it’s also important to feel stylish and look
                                confident at work. In addition, your workwear should also be comfortable, because what
                                we wear influences
                                our working atmosphere. A uniform style isn’t about repeating or wearing the same thing
                                over and over - it’s
                                about having a signature look and a selection of classic pieces in your wardrobe where
                                you can mix and match
                                anything!&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p></p>
                <p><b>Choose The Best</b></p>
                <p><span>Nowadays, many modern workplaces offer their employees a choice when it comes to
                                selecting their workwear. If you have such an option in your workplace, always choose
                                the workwear that
                                works best for you, and the workwear that you feel the most comfortable in. If women
                                prefer to not show
                                their legs, then opting for the pants rather than the skirt works wonders - these tiny
                                choices will
                                monumentally improve how you look and feel at work!&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><b>You Always Have Control Over Your Look</b></p>
                <p><span>Even if you’re wearing uniform or workwear, you always do have an element of
                                choice to control your look. Your hair, make-up, accessories, and shoes are integral
                                parts of the styling
                                process. Always opt for the latest trending fashion to stay relevant. For women, it’s a
                                great tip to always
                                carry around a scarf and for men, a jacket is a must, just in case you want to add some
                                glam to your office
                                look or change up your appearance respectively.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><b>What’s Your Workwear Style?</b></p>
                <p><span>Always keep in mind that your style plays a part in your identity as well. What
                                you can do to keep it fresh in the formal look department is to switch things up,
                                keeping the baseline style
                                in place. For example, if you are a person who always prefers button-up shirts and
                                tailored pants, a great
                                tip is to build on to that by adding a blazer or adding accessories which will enhance
                                your
                                look.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><br><br></p>
                <p><b>What Fabric Person Are You?</b></p>
                <p><span>Cotton, linen, suede and other materials are the usual fabrics that adorn a
                                formal wardrobe. Cotton is known for giving a crisp and distinguished look. Linen is
                                known for its refined
                                elegance, as well as its reliability and durability. Suede is highly classy as well!
                                It’s great to have a
                                fabric that you prefer the most, but it’s also interesting to change it up from time to
                                time.&nbsp;</span>
                </p>
                <p><br><br><br></p>
                <p><b>Colour Palette</b></p>
                <p><span>Your uniform style doesn’t necessarily always have to be on the darker tones.
                                Pale greys and pastels are always a good choice! Always create a colour palette for your
                                wardrobe, so you
                                can have a minimalistic set of clothes that can be matched with each other in no time at
                                all.&nbsp;</span>
                </p>
                <p><br><br><br></p>
                <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                <p><span>The perception, for the longest time, has been centred around the fact that style
                                and workwear are the opposite ends of the spectrum - however, those days are long gone!
                                As long as you
                                choose your formal wardrobe the right way, invest in the right type of clothing, and
                                style your formal wear
                                strategically and smartly, your look will give you the right amount of confidence to do
                                (and look) excellent
                                at work!</span></p>
